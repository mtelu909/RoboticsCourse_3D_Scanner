MASTER:

This Project aims to build a 3D scannar capable of converting an image to a matrix of heights.



ScanArray:

In this branch we shall attempt to break down a single laser line into an array of heights.
To do this we shall use the laserline.jpg and Array_Scan.py code included in the 3D_Scan Folder.
